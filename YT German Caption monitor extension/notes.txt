Steps to clean data for my german extension:

I want my german words collection into an array where the odd number of indexes holds the german words and their corresponding even number indexes holds the meaning of that word. 

To make it double quoted before using it as an array:
-----------------------------------------------------
regex to select all characters seperated by comma, : ([^,]+)
replace it with double quotation: "\\$1"
to clear the empty spaces: \s*"\s*(.*?)\s*"\s*
replace with: "\\$1"


next plans:
1. make the repeated function(caption monitor) on clicking a button or pressing something on keyboard, stop it if the video is paused and start again if it is played. Add event listeners for reference.

also, ytAutoQualitySelector file, assign the quality selector to a button instead of running it continuously in the background. later on, make a html button beside the play pause video controls of youtube.

2. make the python server for dynamic translation
3. make corrections for the dynamically ai generated transcripts by youtube
