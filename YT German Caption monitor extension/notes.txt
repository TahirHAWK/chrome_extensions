Steps to clean data for my german extension:

I want my german words collection into an array where the odd number of indexes holds the german words and their corresponding even number indexes holds the meaning of that word. 

To make it double quoted before using it as an array:
-----------------------------------------------------
regex to select all characters seperated by comma, : ([^,]+)
replace it with double quotation: "\\$1"
to clear the empty spaces: \s*"\s*(.*?)\s*"\s*
replace with: "\\$1"


next plans:
1. try the translation method collecting from caption segment instead of searching for active caption tab in the caption traverser.
2. make an array in background script where the processed strings will be kept, so before processing it, it will also be checked there
