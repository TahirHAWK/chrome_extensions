Steps to clean data for my german extension:

I want my german words collection into an array where the odd number of indexes holds the german words and their corresponding even number indexes holds the meaning of that word. 

To make it double quoted before using it as an array:
-----------------------------------------------------
regex to select all characters seperated by comma, : ([^,]+)
replace it with double quotation: "\\$1"
to clear the empty spaces: \s*"\s*(.*?)\s*"\s*
replace with: "\\$1"


next plans:
1. make the repeated function(caption monitor) on clicking a button or pressing something on keyboard, stop it if the video is paused and start again if it is played. Add event listeners for reference.

also, ytAutoQualitySelector file, assign the quality selector to a button instead of running it continuously in the background. later on, make a html button beside the play pause video controls of youtube.

2. on background script, document properly which part of the background script is coming from which content script.

3. DONE - already done, but i have to do the same for the German to english wordlist, so that the words will be found easily. tip: copy the hardcoded wordlist in nodejs, write a program which will make the english words keys and the german ones values, and write it on a txt file inside the node project as a string shaped as an object, later you can just copy it and paste it to where it was before.

DONE - use object on desired caption and raw caption, sample format might be like this, which will save execution cycles and find already processed captions easily, hopefully it will solve the 'undefined' problem in the captions. Sample format: 

let alreadyUsedCaption = {
    "Guten Tag":"Guten(good) Tag(day)"
}
